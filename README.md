# Room-Scene--Unity
PROJECT- UNITY 

MyFirstGame!

Brief description of the scene:
It showcases several facets of my work with Virtual Reality (VR), such as 3D modeling with VR Tools, development and programming. Therefore I've created a room environment.This VR work involves texturing, importing elements from the asset store, scaling, lighting, transforms and so on. 
Within this environment you will experience several furnitures (3D objects) usually present in a room- 

 1.Bed with pillows

2. 2 tables- 1 study table and 1 round table

3. 2 chairs

4. Dressing table

5. Almirah  and other such furnitures.

And 4 walls, 1 roof and 1 floor- obviously. 

I worked on:
Windows 10; Unity 2019.4.2;
